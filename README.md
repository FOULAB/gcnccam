GCNCCam
=======

Tool for generating gcode from dxfs, used in the Foulab CNC toolchain.  Recently tested to build on Ubuntu Trusty.  Note that 
is important to actually build and install, as it installs a bunch of pixmaps that it expect to load.  Copying the binary around
as we have done in the past works only by sheer luck.

Recent compilation fix is a patch in the worst sense.  The original tool used Arjuta and glade, but in the very early days. 
The ideal approach would have been to reuse those tools to recreate the fixed, compilable version.  However, was unable to get
them to process the old project successfully, so the autogenerated source code was patched. Advice from an expert in the Gnome gui tools could be very helpful here.
